# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project involves creating a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. The game will be played between two players on the same device. The website will have a responsive design and will display the game board, a reset button, and a message indicating the game's status (e.g., which player's turn it is, or if someone has won).
